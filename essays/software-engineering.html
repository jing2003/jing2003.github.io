<p><em>With amazing skills in software engineering, your future is endless!</em></p>

<h2 id="my-interest-in-software-engineering">My interest in software engineering</h2>

<p>I have no idea what software engineering is. My interest in programming started back when I was a high school student. I applied for an information technology course in junior year and I am very glad to make this decision. While attending Mr. Kamâ€™s information technology class, my interest in software engineering continues to grow. Mr. Kam was the one who helped me to widen my interest in software engineering and I have a plan to become a software engineer.</p>

<p>At first, I thought programming was something easy, where you can sit in an office and do just coding. This is definitely wrong. Mr. Kam made me realize that programming is something that can be very complicated, but fun at the same time. Software engineering is something where you will design, build and test software applications from analyzing user requirements. You also have to save the transmission data between the server and web browser and provide automation frameworks and interactive features. There are so much more than these.</p>

<p>The projects that Mr. Kam assigns are usually individual projects, but we can discuss our ideas with friends or classmates. Some projects are very simple and easy to complete, but others require so much time and effort. I usually spend a lot of time trying to understand how to design and code my project. I want my project to look nice, so I spend a lot of time on choosing the colors, fonts, images, etc. I also spend a lot of time on understanding how HTML and JavaScript work together and interact with the user. The more time I spend on these projects, the more I love software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="my-future-in-software-engineering">My future in software engineering</h2>

<p>As I become more interested in software engineering, I am also interested in artificial intelligence. I am interested in both the front and back end development, so I want to become more skilled in building and designing websites along with making user interaction features. I really want to improve and expand my skills and if possible, combine them with artificial intelligence. In the future, I hope that I can build an artificial intelligence project with skills of software engineering.</p>
