<h2 id="the-start-of-my-journey">The start of my journey</h2>

<p>I am always amazed by coding and all the things that are created by programmers. I was lucky that my high school offered coding courses. My high school coding teacher, Mr. Kam, was very energetic and eager to teach his students about coding and this is where I began to learn about coding stuff. At first, I thought everyone in the world code in the same language because I thought that there was only one programming language. However, I was wrong when Mr. Kam introduced so many coding languages: HTML, CSS, JS, and Python. I was overwhelmed and amazed once again.</p>

<p>I took his courses for two years and was really glad to have him as my teacher. Although my level in these languages is not very high, I felt accomplished. Mr. Kam assigned different projects with challenging requirements, but I felt so happy that I was able to use what I learned from him and completed his projects. I am planning to list three projects from Mr. Kam into my professional profile because I am really proud of what I made.</p>

<h2 id="have-to-be-careful">Have to be careful</h2>

<p>Coding is fun, but stressful at the same time. I felt like in all coding languages, you really have to be careful with syntax. If you somehow forgot a semicolon or comma, this will create bugs or errors. Then it’s possible for you to spend hours looking for what’s wrong and this happens to me a few times. I am glad to complete the basic JavaScript exercises in FreeCodeCamp to refresh my memory about JavaScript and remind me about the syntaxes.</p>

<h2 id="current-thoughts-on-software-engineering">Current thoughts on software engineering</h2>

<p>I felt like JavaScript is an awesome programming language for a software engineer. Software engineering will design, build and test software applications from analyzing user requirements. JavaScript can be really useful because it saves the transmission data between the server and web browser and provides automation frameworks and interactive features.</p>

<p>Athletic software engineering education is challenging, but very useful. When I am trying to solve a problem within a time limit, it’s stressful because it really requires me to know my stuff well. The practice WODs (workout of the day) really made me think that if I know my stuff well, I wouldn’t feel pressured because I can do it.</p>
