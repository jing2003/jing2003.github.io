Ask smart questions

The start of my journey

I am always amazed by coding and all the things that are created by programmers. I was lucky that my high school offered coding courses. My high school coding teacher, Mr. Kam, was very energetic and eager to teach his students about coding and this is where I began to learn about coding stuff. At first, I thought everyone in the world code in the same language because I thought that there was only one programming language. However, I was wrong when Mr. Kam introduced so many coding languages: HTML, CSS, JS, and Python. I was overwhelmed and amazed once again.

I took his courses for two years and was really glad to have him as my teacher. Although my level in these languages is not very high, I felt accomplished. Mr. Kam assigned different projects with challenging requirements, but I felt so happy that I was able to use what I learned from him and completed his projects. I am planning to list three projects from Mr. Kam into my professional profile because I am really proud of what I made.
