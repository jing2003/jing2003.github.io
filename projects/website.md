## Design of the project

Tea Cat Cafe is the name of my simple website project. I spent a lot of time designing how the website should look and where to position my div boxes. The div boxes are the HTML division tag, a special element that lets you group similar sets of content together on a web page. Here is a part of my code that shows that I have a lot of div boxes in the HTML file for home page:

```
<div id="top">
  <div id="logo"></div>
  <div id="title">Tea Cat Cafe</div>
  <a href="home.html"><div id="home">HOME</div></a>
  <a href="menu.html"><div id="menu">MENU</div></a>
  <a href="cat.html"><div id="cat">CAT</div></a>
  <a href="about.html"><div id="about">ABOUT US</div></a>
</div>
    
<div id="slogan">Come in and relax with food/drink and pat pat PAT!!!</div>
    
<div id="front"></div>
   
<div class="heading">Most Popular Items</div>
    
<div class="box">
  <div class="item1">
    <div id="img1" class="image"></div>
    <div class="descrip">Taro Milk Tea</div>
  </div>
  <div class="item2">
    <div id="img2" class="image"></div>
    <div class="descrip">Green Tea</div>
  </div>
  <div class="item3">
    <div id="img3" class="image"></div>
    <div class="descrip">Pudding</div>
  </div>
</div>
    
<div class="heading">Cat of the Month: Jenny</div>
   
<div id="cat6"></div>
    
<div id="bottom">
  <p>Address: 415 Kapahulu Ave, Honolulu, HI 96815   /   Phone: (808)-1212-3434  /     Email: teacatcafe@gamil.com</p>
</div>
```

In the CSS file, I have to spend a lot of time designing my div boxes. I have to think about the distance between the div boxes and size of div boxes. I have to think about the position of the div boxes (margins, fixed position, etc.).

## My Role

This is an individual project that was done by myself.

## My experience

Some people might think that designing something is easy. However, while doing this project, designing is something that really requires a lot of time and effort. For this project, there were four HTML files corresponding to each page that I showed above. Designing these pages made me feel crazy. In each page, I have a lot of div boxes. I have to keep track of these div boxes which made me realize that naming is very important. If you donâ€™t keep track of your names (id and classes of the div boxes), you will have a hard time looking for the div box you need.
